Hi, Monsieur.

I studied your task2 document and then write this proposal.


1. Questions
 I understand Plugin(Situation1) but don't understand Plugin(Situation2)
 When FCM send message, it will go to app.
 If app is offline, fcm message will be pending. When app is back online, it will be sent automatically by fcm cloud service.
 
 So "When USER A will get back (WIFI, LTE DATA PLAN, or came back online  after a re-start) Firebase will send a xmpp available to Openfire, and Openfire will send to FCM all notification storing (pending)"
  It is really not necessary.

 What do you think of it?

2. Project skills.
 Java, JDBC, OpenFire Plugin Development(with Eclipse)

3. Project Price and Period
 Price: $25/hr
 Period: 40hrs


Looking forward to your good reply.
Thank you.

From Gosto.
